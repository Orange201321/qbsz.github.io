      <h1>Army Day:</h1>
      <p>After the Communist Party of China was established on July 23, 1921, under the brutal rule of the reactionary warlord government, it could only be in a secret state, without an open environment for activities. During the Great Revolution, the party was busy with the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, launched the workers and peasants movement, and supported the Northern Expedition War. It had no conditions to commemorate the birth of the party. It was proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong in May 1938 to make July 1 the birthday of the Communist Party of China. At that time, Mao Zedong put forward in his article "On the Protracted War": "July 1st this year is the 17th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China." This is the first time that the leading comrades of the central government have clearly stated that "July 1" is the anniversary of the birth of the party.</p>
